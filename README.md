> Confidential, production-grade Zero-Knowledge access control gateway built on the Midnight Network. Nexora lets users prove they are authorized to access a resource — without ever revealing their identity, wallet history, or the underlying credential.

**Nexora** replaces traditional wallet-based allowlists and token-gated access with a Zero-Knowledge Merkle membership proof. Members prove they hold a valid, enrolled credential and generate a single-use nullifier locally in their browser — nothing sensitive ever touches the chain. Built for the **First Quarter (Level 3)** challenge as part of the **RiseIn & Midnight Foundation "New Moon to Full: Monthly Moonshots on Midnight" Program 2026**.

## 💡 What This Does

Nexora is a privacy-preserving access gateway where:

1. **Admins** deploy an access gate on the Midnight Preprod network and enroll authorized members by hashing their credentials into a Merkle Tree.
2. **Members** connect their wallet (Lace or 1AM) and paste their secret credential locally in the browser.
3. A Zero-Knowledge proof is generated client-side, proving the credential's hash is a valid leaf in the enrolled Merkle Tree **and** that its nullifier has never been used before.
4. Only the **proof**, the **Merkle root check result**, and the **nullifier** are recorded on-chain — the raw credential, wallet identity, and Merkle path are **never transmitted or stored anywhere**.
5. Once verified, the member's session vault unlocks — access granted, identity still unknown.

---

## 🔒 Privacy Model

### What is PUBLIC (On-Chain — Visible to Everyone)

- Merkle root of enrolled credential hashes
- Set of spent nullifiers
- Admin address
- Whether a given access gate is active

### What is PRIVATE (Off-Chain — Never Leaves Your Browser)

- 🔒 Your raw secret credential
- 🔒 Your Merkle inclusion path
- 🔒 Your wallet identity linkage to the credential
- 🔒 All witness input values

### What the User PROVES Without Revealing

- ✅ That their credential hash is a valid leaf in the Merkle Tree (membership)
- ✅ That their nullifier has not been used before (no replay)
- ✅ That the proof was authorized by a connected wallet
- ❌ The actual secret credential is **never disclosed**
- ❌ Which specific leaf/identity in the tree they correspond to is **never disclosed**

---

## 🛡️ Privacy Claim

> **An on-chain observer can see** that a valid membership proof was submitted, a nullifier was inserted into the spent set, and the Merkle root remains unchanged. **An on-chain observer CANNOT see** which credential produced the proof, the member's wallet-to-credential linkage, or any private witness inputs. The ZK circuit mathematically proves Merkle membership and nullifier uniqueness without passing the raw secret through `disclose()`. The private witness callbacks execute exclusively on the client machine, and their return values never enter the public ledger state.

This is verified by the automated test suite, which confirms that private witness values do not appear in the serialized public contract state after circuit execution.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Authentication** — Authenticate without revealing the original credential.
- 🌳 **Merkle Tree Allowlist** — Authorized members are represented as hashed leaves; only hashes are ever stored.
- ♻️ **Nullifier Protection** — Each successful proof generates a unique nullifier; spent nullifiers are permanently rejected, preventing replay attacks.
- 👤 **Admin Console** — Deploy new access gates, enroll credential hashes, generate member credentials, share access links, and restore published gates.
- 🔑 **Secure Member Access** — Connect wallet → paste secret → generate proof → unlock access. No sensitive data ever leaves the browser.
- 🔌 **Multi-Wallet Support** — Connect and disconnect cleanly with Lace or 1AM wallet extensions.
- 🔍 **Frontend Circuit Execution** — Call `verify_access()` directly from the browser with real-time proof generation feedback.
- 🏷️ **Privacy Label** — "Proved without revealing your input" displayed after every successful circuit call.
- 📊 **Explorer Integration** — Automatic explorer links for every transaction and contract deployment.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Current token-gated and allowlist-based platforms require users to expose sensitive information simply to prove they belong:

- Wallet-based allowlists reveal wallet addresses and transaction history
- Token-gated communities expose NFT holdings and token balances
- Private events and DAO memberships leak participation history
- Beta testing platforms tie access directly to identifiable wallets

This creates unnecessary privacy risk for a problem that should require zero disclosure.

---

## 💡 Solution

Nexora introduces a Zero-Knowledge access gateway. Instead of exposing a credential to prove access, the flow is:

```
Secret Credential
       ↓
Generate ZK Proof (Merkle membership + nullifier)
       ↓
Blockchain Verification
       ↓
Access Granted
```

Only proof validity reaches the blockchain. Secrets remain private forever.

```

- **Public Ledger State (`export ledger`)**: Stores the Merkle root and spent nullifiers. Everyone can inspect these fields.
- **Private Witness Callbacks (`witness`)**: Declares local functions that run _exclusively on the member's client machine_.
- **Deliberate Selective Disclosure**: The `verify_access()` circuit asserts Merkle membership and nullifier uniqueness. Upon success, it inserts the nullifier into the spent set. **No credential or identity is ever passed to `disclose()`**, proving valid membership while preserving 100% credential secrecy.

cd Nexora
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Compile the Compact Smart Contract (WSL/Linux)

```bash
npm run compile
```

### 4. Run the Automated Test Suite

```bash
npm test
```

### 5. Start the Proof Server (Docker)

```bash
docker start proof-server
```

### 6. Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### 7. Connect Wallet & Call Circuit

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` → click **Launch App**
2. Click **Connect Wallet** → select **Lace** or **1AM** → approve in extension
3. Navigate to the **Member Access** page
4. Paste your secret credential and click **Generate Proof — Verify Access**
5. Wait for ZK proof generation (30–60 seconds)
6. See "Proved without revealing your input" confirmation and unlock the vault

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

The test suite validates:

- Admin permissions
- Allowlist enrollment behavior
- Merkle membership verification logic
- Nullifier replay prevention

> Testing uses mocked in-memory structures for fast iteration; end-to-end proof generation is verified separately via the browser proof server.

## ⚙️ CI/CD

A GitHub Actions workflow compiles the Compact contract and runs the full test suite on every push and pull request.

```
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Frontend

Deploy directly to Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
```

Import the repository into Vercel. No production environment variables are required.

### Smart Contract

Contracts are deployed through the built-in Admin Dashboard. Each deployment creates a unique contract address on Midnight Preprod. Preprod deployment is pending until you connect a funded Preprod wallet and deploy from /admin.

---

## 🛡️ Security Model

Nexora never stores:

- Raw credentials
- Identity information
- Wallet history
- Private keys

Only the following exist on-chain:

- Credential hashes (as Merkle leaves)
- The Merkle root
- Spent nullifiers

Replay attacks are prevented using cryptographic nullifiers — every proof is single-use and cannot be replayed.

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-gate management
- [ ] Expiring credentials
- [ ] Anonymous DAO voting
- [ ] Enterprise identity verification
- [ ] API access gateway
- [ ] Multi-admin governance
- [ ] zkBadge support
- [ ] NFT private membership
- [ ] OAuth integration
- [ ] Cross-chain proof verification
